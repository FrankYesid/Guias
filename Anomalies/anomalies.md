# Anomalies

This directory contains projects and code related to anomaly detection in machine learning.

## Description

Anomaly detection involves identifying rare items, events, or observations that raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data. This folder includes various methods and techniques used to detect anomalies in different datasets.

## Contents

- `data/`: Contains example datasets used for anomaly detection.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step implementations and explanations.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for anomaly detection.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models for detecting anomalies.
- `results/`: Output results from running the anomaly detection models.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the contents and structure.

## Methods

The following anomaly detection methods are covered in this directory:

1. **Statistical Methods**:
    - Z-Score
    - Modified Z-Score
    - IQR (Interquartile Range)

2. **Machine Learning Methods**:
    - Isolation Forest
    - One-Class SVM
    - Autoencoders

3. **Other Methods**:
    - DBSCAN
    - K-Means for anomaly detection

## Usage

To get started with the anomaly detection projects, you can follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-projects.git
    cd machine-learning-projects/Anomalies
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Explore the notebooks**:
    Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder to understand the implementation of different anomaly detection techniques.

## Examples

### Isolation Forest

Isolation Forest is an efficient model for anomaly detection. Below is a basic example of how to use it:

# Contributing
If you would like to contribute to this directory, please follow the standard GitHub workflow for contributions. Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

# Python
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np

# Example data
X = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 2], [8, 8], [9, 9], [10, 10]])

# Create IsolationForest model
model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.2)

# Fit the model
model.fit(X)

# Predict anomalies
predictions = model.predict(X)
print(predictions)

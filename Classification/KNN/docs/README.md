# Documentation for KNN Classification Project

This document provides an overview of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, resources for further study, and references to relevant literature. This section is intended to help anyone working on this project to understand the underlying theory and best practices for applying KNN to classification tasks.

## 1. Overview of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

### What is KNN?

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple, non-parametric, and instance-based learning algorithm. It is commonly used for classification tasks, where the goal is to predict the class label of a new instance based on its similarity to a set of training examples.

The main idea behind KNN is to find the `k` nearest data points (neighbors) to the new instance in the feature space and assign a label based on the majority class of those neighbors.

### Key Concepts:

- **Distance Metric**: KNN relies on a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance, to measure the similarity between instances. The distance between points is calculated, and the `k` closest points are used for prediction.
  
- **Choice of k**: The number of neighbors (`k`) is a crucial hyperparameter. A small `k` might lead to a highly sensitive model (high variance), while a large `k` can lead to a smoother decision boundary (higher bias).

- **Instance-Based Learning**: Unlike other machine learning algorithms, KNN does not explicitly build a model. Instead, it memorizes the entire training dataset and makes predictions based on stored instances at the time of query.

### Advantages of KNN:

- **Simplicity**: KNN is easy to implement and understand, with no need for parameter estimation or training a model.
- **Flexibility**: Can handle multiclass classification and be applied to regression tasks by averaging the target values of the neighbors.
- **Non-parametric**: Makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.

### Disadvantages of KNN:

- **Computationally Expensive**: As the size of the training dataset increases, the cost of finding the nearest neighbors becomes computationally expensive.
- **Curse of Dimensionality**: In high-dimensional spaces, the concept of distance becomes less meaningful, leading to reduced performance.
- **Sensitive to Noise**: KNN is sensitive to outliers or noise in the data, which can lead to incorrect predictions.

## 2. Steps to Implement KNN

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Load and clean the dataset.
   - Normalize or standardize the feature values to ensure consistent scaling.
   
2. **Distance Calculation**: 
   - Use a distance metric like Euclidean, Manhattan, or Minkowski distance to calculate the distance between the query point and all other points in the dataset.
   
3. **Find Neighbors**: 
   - Identify the `k` closest neighbors to the query point based on the chosen distance metric.
   
4. **Make Prediction**: 
   - For classification, the predicted class is determined by a majority vote among the `k` nearest neighbors.
   - For regression, the prediction is the average of the target values of the neighbors.

5. **Evaluate Performance**: 
   - Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to evaluate the performance of the KNN classifier.

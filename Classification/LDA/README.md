# LDA Classification Example

This directory contains a practical example of applying **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** for classification tasks. LDA is a powerful technique used in machine learning and statistics to find a linear combination of features that best separates two or more classes of data.

## Contents

- **`data/`**: This folder includes the datasets used in this example. The data is preprocessed and ready for analysis.
- **`lda_classification.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook that walks through the implementation of LDA for classification, including data exploration, model training, and evaluation.
- **`results/`**: Output files and plots generated from the analysis, such as confusion matrices and decision boundary visualizations.
- **`utils.py`**: A Python script containing utility functions for data preprocessing and visualization.

## Requirements

To run the notebook and scripts, you need the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

You can install the required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Load the dataset**: Start by exploring the dataset to understand its structure and the classes you will be classifying.
2. **Apply LDA**: Implement LDA to find the linear discriminants that maximize class separability.
3. **Model Training**: Train the LDA model using the training dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Visualization**: Generate plots to visualize the decision boundaries and the separation between classes.

## Results

The results from the LDA model are saved in the `results/` folder. Key outputs include:

- **Confusion Matrix**: To assess the performance of the classification.
- **Decision Boundary Plot**: A graphical representation of how the model separates the different classes.

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates how to effectively apply LDA for classification purposes. It highlights the steps involved in data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

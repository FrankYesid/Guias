# Results

This folder contains the results of the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) classification applied to the MNIST dataset. The results include model performance metrics, visualizations, and any other output generated during the analysis.

## Contents

- **`confusion_matrix.png`**: A heatmap visualization of the confusion matrix showing the performance of the LDA model on the validation or test set.
- **`classification_report.txt`**: A text file containing the precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each digit class, generated after evaluating the LDA model.
- **`lda_2d_projection.png`**: (Optional) A scatter plot showing the projection of the MNIST data onto the first two Linear Discriminants. This file is included if the 2D projection step was performed.
- **`test_predictions.csv`**: A CSV file containing the predicted labels for the test dataset. Each row corresponds to a test image, and the column contains the predicted digit (0-9).
- **`validation_accuracy.txt`**: A text file recording the validation accuracy achieved by the LDA model.

## How to Interpret the Results

- **Confusion Matrix**: This matrix provides insight into which digits are being correctly classified and which ones are being misclassified. The diagonal elements represent correct predictions, while off-diagonal elements indicate misclassifications.

- **Classification Report**: This report provides detailed performance metrics for each digit class, including precision (the proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct), recall (the proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly), and the F1-score (a weighted average of precision and recall).

- **2D Projection**: If generated, this visualization helps understand how well the LDA model separates the classes in a lower-dimensional space. It is useful for visual inspection but may not be necessary for practical model evaluation.

- **Test Predictions**: These are the model's predictions for the unseen test dataset. This file can be used to submit results to a competition or to further evaluate the model's performance on new data.

- **Validation Accuracy**: This file records the overall accuracy of the model on the validation set, providing a quick metric to gauge model performance.

## Conclusion

The results stored in this folder are critical for evaluating the effectiveness of the LDA model on the MNIST dataset. By analyzing these outputs, one can determine the strengths and weaknesses of the model and make informed decisions about potential improvements or alternative approaches.

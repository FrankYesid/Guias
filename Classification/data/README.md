# MNIST Dataset

This folder contains the MNIST dataset, a widely recognized benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9), each image being 28x28 pixels in grayscale.

## Contents

- **`train.csv`**: This file contains the training data. Each row represents an image, with the first column containing the label (the digit) and the remaining 784 columns containing the pixel values (flattened 28x28 grid).
- **`test.csv`**: This file contains the test data. Each row represents an image, with 784 columns containing the pixel values. The label for each image is not included in this file, as it is typically used for model prediction.

- **`README.md`**: This file, which provides an overview of the dataset and its contents.

## Dataset Overview

The MNIST dataset is a large collection of handwritten digits, which has been a standard in training and testing machine learning algorithms for image processing tasks. It is particularly useful for tasks such as:

- Image classification
- Pattern recognition
- Benchmarking machine learning models

Each image is labeled with the digit it represents, and the goal is to correctly classify each image.

## Data Format

- **`train.csv`**: Each row starts with the label (0-9) followed by 784 integers representing the pixel values (0-255) in a 28x28 grayscale image.
- **`test.csv`**: Each row contains 784 integers representing the pixel values (0-255) in a 28x28 grayscale image, without a corresponding label.

## How to Use

To load the dataset in Python, you can use the `pandas` library to read the `.csv` files and prepare them for analysis. Here’s an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the training data
train_df = pd.read_csv('train.csv')

# Separate features and labels
X_train = train_df.iloc[:, 1:].values  # Pixel values
y_train = train_df.iloc[:, 0].values   # Labels

# Load the test data
test_df = pd.read_csv('test.csv')
X_test = test_df.values  # Pixel values
```

## Visualization

You can visualize the images using `matplotlib`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Display the first image in the training set
plt.imshow(X_train[0].reshape(28, 28), cmap='gray')
plt.title(f'Label: {y_train[0]}')
plt.show()
```

## License

The MNIST dataset is freely available and can be used for educational purposes and research. However, if you use this dataset in your work, it’s customary to cite the original creators: Yann LeCun, Corinna Cortes, and Christopher J.C. Burges.

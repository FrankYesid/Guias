# Method_and_Metrics_ML

This repository contains a collection of common methods and metrics used in the field of machine learning, along with their implementation in Python.

## Repository Description

The main goal of this repository is to provide a centralized reference for various machine learning methods and associated metrics for evaluating model performance.

## Folder and File Structure

- `/methods`: Contains implementations of different machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision tree classification, etc.
- `/metrics`: Includes code for calculating model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, etc.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the repository and how to use it.

## Documentation

In each folder (`/methods` and `/metrics`), you'll find additional README files that explain each method and metric in detail, along with usage examples and additional references.

## Source Code

The source code is primarily written in Python and is well-documented to facilitate understanding and usage.

## Requirements and Dependencies

To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Pandas

You can install these dependencies by running:

# Algebra

Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with symbols and the rules for manipulating those symbols. It is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics and includes everything from solving elementary equations to studying abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields.

## Key Concepts

### Variables and Constants
- **Variables:** Symbols that represent numbers or values (e.g., x, y, z).
- **Constants:** Fixed values that do not change (e.g., 2, -5, Ï€).

### Expressions
An algebraic expression is a combination of variables, constants, and operators (e.g., \(3x + 2y - 5\)).

### Equations
An equation is a statement that asserts the equality of two expressions (e.g., \(3x + 2 = 11\)).

### Inequalities
An inequality is a relation that holds between two values when they are different (e.g., \(x > 5\), \(y \leq 3\)).

### Polynomials
A polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients, combined using addition, subtraction, and multiplication (e.g., \(4x^2 + 3x - 7\)).

- **Degree:** The highest power of the variable in the polynomial (e.g., the degree of \(4x^2 + 3x - 7\) is 2).

## Basic Operations

### Addition and Subtraction
Combining like terms by adding or subtracting their coefficients (e.g., \(3x + 2x = 5x\)).

### Multiplication
Distributing each term in the first polynomial to every term in the second polynomial (e.g., \((2x + 3)(x - 4) = 2x^2 - 8x + 3x - 12\)).

### Division
Dividing polynomials by using long division or synthetic division.

### Factoring
Expressing a polynomial as a product of its factors (e.g., \(x^2 - 9 = (x + 3)(x - 3)\)).

## Solving Equations

### Linear Equations
Equations of the first degree (e.g., \(2x + 3 = 7\)).

- **Solution:** Isolating the variable to find its value (e.g., \(2x + 3 = 7 \Rightarrow 2x = 4 \Rightarrow x = 2\)).

### Quadratic Equations
Equations of the second degree (e.g., \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 0\)).

- **Solutions:**
  - Factoring (e.g., \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 2\)).
  - Quadratic formula: \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\).

### Systems of Equations
A set of equations with multiple variables (e.g., \(2x + y = 5\) and \(3x - y = 4\)).

- **Solution Methods:**
  - Substitution: Solving one equation for one variable and substituting the result into the other equation.
  - Elimination: Adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable.

## Functions

### Definition
A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of permissible outputs, typically defined by an equation (e.g., \(f(x) = 2x + 3\)).

### Domain and Range
- **Domain:** The set of all possible input values (x-values) for the function.
- **Range:** The set of all possible output values (y-values) for the function.

### Common Functions
- **Linear Functions:** \(f(x) = mx + b\), where \(m\) is the slope and \(b\) is the y-intercept.
- **Quadratic Functions:** \(f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants.

## Advanced Topics

### Matrices
Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers that can be used to represent systems of linear equations and perform linear transformations.

- **Operations:** Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and finding the determinant and inverse.

### Vectors
Vectors are quantities with both magnitude and direction, used in various fields such as physics and engineering.

- **Operations:** Addition, subtraction, dot product, and cross product.

### Complex Numbers
Complex numbers extend the real numbers by including the imaginary unit \(i\), where \(i^2 = -1\).

- **Form:** \(a + bi\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are real numbers.

Algebra is a foundational tool in mathematics, providing the language and structure for expressing and solving a wide range of problems. Understanding its basic concepts and operations is essential for further study in mathematics and its applications.

# Geometry

Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of points, lines, surfaces, and shapes. It plays a crucial role in various fields such as art, architecture, engineering, and physics.

## Key Concepts

### Points, Lines, and Planes
- **Point:** A location with no dimension (e.g., point A).
- **Line:** A straight one-dimensional figure extending infinitely in both directions (e.g., line AB).
- **Plane:** A flat two-dimensional surface extending infinitely in all directions (e.g., plane ABC).

### Angles
- **Acute Angle:** An angle less than 90 degrees.
- **Right Angle:** An angle of exactly 90 degrees.
- **Obtuse Angle:** An angle greater than 90 degrees but less than 180 degrees.
- **Straight Angle:** An angle of exactly 180 degrees.

### Triangles
- **Types by Sides:**
  - **Equilateral Triangle:** All sides and angles are equal.
  - **Isosceles Triangle:** Two sides and two angles are equal.
  - **Scalene Triangle:** All sides and angles are different.
- **Types by Angles:**
  - **Acute Triangle:** All angles are less than 90 degrees.
  - **Right Triangle:** One angle is exactly 90 degrees.
  - **Obtuse Triangle:** One angle is greater than 90 degrees.

### Quadrilaterals
- **Square:** Four equal sides and four right angles.
- **Rectangle:** Opposite sides are equal, and all angles are right angles.
- **Parallelogram:** Opposite sides are equal and parallel.
- **Rhombus:** All sides are equal, and opposite angles are equal.
- **Trapezoid:** At least one pair of parallel sides.

### Circles
- **Radius:** A line segment from the center to the circumference.
- **Diameter:** A line segment passing through the center, connecting two points on the circumference (twice the radius).
- **Circumference:** The distance around the circle.
- **Area:** The space enclosed by the circle, calculated as \( \pi r^2 \).

## Geometric Transformations
- **Translation:** Moving a shape without rotating or flipping it.
- **Rotation:** Turning a shape around a fixed point.
- **Reflection:** Flipping a shape over a line to create a mirror image.
- **Scaling:** Enlarging or shrinking a shape while maintaining its proportions.

## Theorems and Properties

### Pythagorean Theorem
In a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.

- **Formula:** \( a^2 + b^2 = c^2 \)

### Similarity and Congruence
- **Similar Figures:** Figures that have the same shape but different sizes. Corresponding angles are equal, and corresponding sides are proportional.
- **Congruent Figures:** Figures that are identical in shape and size. Corresponding sides and angles are equal.

### Properties of Angles
- **Complementary Angles:** Two angles that add up to 90 degrees.
- **Supplementary Angles:** Two angles that add up to 180 degrees.
- **Vertical Angles:** Opposite angles formed by two intersecting lines, equal in measure.

### Properties of Triangles
- **Triangle Inequality Theorem:** The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side.
- **Sum of Interior Angles:** The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.

### Properties of Circles
- **Central Angle:** An angle whose vertex is at the center of the circle.
- **Inscribed Angle:** An angle formed by two chords in a circle which have a common endpoint.
- **Tangent:** A line that touches the circle at exactly one point.

## Coordinate Geometry
Coordinate geometry, or analytic geometry, is the study of geometry using a coordinate system. Points are represented by their coordinates \((x, y)\) in the Cartesian plane.

### Distance Formula
The distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \]

### Midpoint Formula
The midpoint of the segment connecting two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[ \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right) \]

### Equation of a Line
The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is:
\[ y = mx + b \]
where \( m \) is the slope and \( b \) is the y-intercept.

## Applications of Geometry
Geometry is used in various real-world applications, including:
- **Architecture and Engineering:** Design and construction of buildings and structures.
- **Art and Design:** Creating visually appealing and proportionate works.
- **Physics:** Analyzing shapes, trajectories, and forces.
- **Computer Graphics:** Rendering 2D and 3D shapes and animations.

Understanding the fundamental concepts of geometry is essential for solving problems and applying these principles in various fields.

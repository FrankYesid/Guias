# Probability and Statistics

Probability and statistics are branches of mathematics concerned with analyzing random phenomena and interpreting data. These fields are fundamental in various disciplines, including science, engineering, economics, and social sciences.

## Key Concepts in Probability

### Probability Basics
- **Experiment:** A process that produces a definite outcome (e.g., rolling a die).
- **Outcome:** A possible result of an experiment (e.g., rolling a 4).
- **Sample Space (S):** The set of all possible outcomes (e.g., \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \) for a die).
- **Event:** A subset of the sample space (e.g., rolling an even number).

### Probability of an Event
The probability of an event \( A \) is given by:
\[ P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} \]

### Types of Events
- **Independent Events:** Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other (e.g., flipping two coins).
- **Dependent Events:** Two events are dependent if the occurrence of one affects the occurrence of the other (e.g., drawing two cards from a deck without replacement).
- **Mutually Exclusive Events:** Two events are mutually exclusive if they cannot occur at the same time (e.g., rolling a 3 or a 5 on a die).

### Conditional Probability
The probability of event \( A \) given that event \( B \) has occurred is:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \]

### Bayes' Theorem
Bayes' Theorem relates the conditional and marginal probabilities of events:
\[ P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \]

### Random Variables
A random variable is a variable that takes on numerical values based on the outcomes of a random experiment.
- **Discrete Random Variable:** Takes on a finite or countable number of values (e.g., number of heads in coin tosses).
- **Continuous Random Variable:** Takes on an infinite number of values within a given range (e.g., the height of students).

### Probability Distributions
- **Probability Mass Function (PMF):** For discrete random variables, the PMF gives the probability of each possible value.
- **Probability Density Function (PDF):** For continuous random variables, the PDF gives the relative likelihood of different outcomes.
- **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF):** The CDF gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value.

## Key Concepts in Statistics

### Descriptive Statistics
Descriptive statistics summarize and describe the main features of a data set.
- **Measures of Central Tendency:**
  - **Mean:** The average of the data set.
  - **Median:** The middle value of the data set.
  - **Mode:** The most frequent value in the data set.
- **Measures of Dispersion:**
  - **Range:** The difference between the maximum and minimum values.
  - **Variance:** The average of the squared differences from the mean.
  - **Standard Deviation:** The square root of the variance.

### Inferential Statistics
Inferential statistics use sample data to make generalizations about a population.
- **Population:** The entire group being studied.
- **Sample:** A subset

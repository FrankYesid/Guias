# Data

This directory contains datasets used in various machine learning projects within this repository.

## Description

The `data` folder is structured to store raw datasets, processed data, and any other data-related files necessary for training, testing, and validating machine learning models. Each project typically has its own subfolder within `data` to maintain organization.

## Structure

- **`raw/`**: Contains raw datasets that have not been processed. These are the original files as obtained from the source.
- **`processed/`**: Contains datasets that have been cleaned, normalized, or transformed. These datasets are ready for analysis or model training.
- **`external/`**: Datasets from external sources or references.
- **`README.md`**: This file, providing an overview of the data directory.

## Usage

To use the datasets in this folder:

1. Navigate to the appropriate subfolder (`raw/`, `processed/`, `external/`) to find the dataset you need.
2. Load the dataset using your preferred data handling library (e.g., Pandas, NumPy).

Example using Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load a dataset
df = pd.read_csv('data/processed/example_dataset.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(df.head())
```

## Data Sources

The datasets in this repository may come from a variety of sources, including:

- Public datasets available from online repositories
- Generated data specific to a particular project
- Data collected from web scraping or other data acquisition methods

## Contributing

If you have additional datasets that would benefit this repository, please add them to the appropriate folder and update this README.md with a brief description of the data.

## License
